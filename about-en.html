    <h1>Discover the Project</h1>

    <p class="subtitulo">
      In a context where legal information is increasingly abundant, complex, and constantly evolving, Dissentis.AI was created with the mission of applying artificial intelligence responsibly and effectively in legal, legislative, and regulatory domains.
    </p>

    <p class="subtitulo">
      Our project aims to simplify access to, understanding of, and analysis of legal knowledge through intelligent tools specifically designed for legal professionals, public institutions, legislative bodies, and corporate legal departments.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Common Challenges When Using AI in Legal Settings</h2>

    <ul class="lista">
      <li><strong>Ambiguity and precision of language:</strong> Legal texts require exact and contextual interpretation, which many AI systems fail to achieve.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of traceability and explainability:</strong> Automated decisions from opaque models can generate distrust if not clearly justified.</li>
      <li><strong>Outdated regulations:</strong> Legislation evolves constantly, and many tools do not incorporate real-time updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Integration difficulties:</strong> Most generic AI tools are not designed to interact with legislative databases, case law repositories, or national legal frameworks.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical and legal risks:</strong> Especially concerning privacy, bias, discrimination, and sensitive personal data usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Our Approach</h2>

    <p class="subtitulo">
      Dissentis.AI addresses these challenges with a specialized approach based on AI models trained on legal data, validated by legal experts, and adapted to national and international regulatory frameworks.
    </p>

    <ul class="lista">
      <li>We develop intelligent legal assistants capable of understanding legal language, reasoning, and structure.</li>
      <li>We offer tools for jurisprudence analysis, assisted legal writing, semantic regulation search, and predictive legal risk evaluation.</li>
      <li>We integrate traceability and explainability systems so every AI-generated result can be audited and justified.</li>
      <li>We ensure compliance with data protection laws, information access standards, and algorithmic transparency.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subtitulo">
      At Dissentis.AI, we believe artificial intelligence can transform the legal sector not by replacing professionals, but by enhancing their capacity, precision, and access to legal knowledge. Our commitment is clear: to build ethical, useful, and law-driven technology.
